# Web development

my study on my owm :milky_way:	

https://roadmap.sh/frontend - this is a frontend **roadmap** (it looks very scary at first glance, but in fact it's not so scary) - you can only learn from it.

# :books: You need to read the documentation!

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

https://javascript.info - The modern **JavaScript** tutorial. 
(there is also a translation in [Ukrainian](https://uk.javascript.info/))

[Cheat sheets](https://htmlcheatsheet.com) - HTML, CSS, JS.
